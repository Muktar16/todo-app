Update the app: 

Frontend: 
1. Homepage will show the list of all todos
2. There will be "Add new" button on the top of the page, by clicking on it user will be redirected to a new page with a form to create a new todo.
2. Each todo of the list should have delete and update button.
3. On clicking delete, a prompt will be appeard "Do you really want to delete?", clicking on "Yes" will delete it from DB
4. On clicking the update button, a new page will arrive with a form to update the todo.
5. It's better to use same form component for creating and deleting a todo.
6. Add a filter which will get todos based on priority. for example get all todos that are in priority 3 or less (Advanced)
